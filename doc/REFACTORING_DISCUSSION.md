##Names

* Tyler Meier, tkm22 
* Erik Gregorio, eg158 
* Farzeen Najam, fn26

##Notes
*We talked about how we needed to separate our classes into different packages better 
and so we worked on doing that
*we fixed minor errors dealing with capitalization of classes and such, and making sure the style
of coding was correct throughout
*We shortened some of the long methods in our classes 
*ALSO during lab we didnt create a separate branch and just worked together in main on refactoring or on
our own branches and then merged so in this branch this will be the only thing pushed 
(talked to Professor Duvall about out mistake).
