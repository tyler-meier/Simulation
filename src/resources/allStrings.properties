Explain_Label = Click on “Choose Simulation” to choose the file for the simulation that you would like to run. Once you choose the first simulation, you will be able to switch to a different simulation from the current simulation scene. You will not be able to come back to this main menu screen. Have fun looking at the simulations!

PercolationRules = Percolation Rules:\n 1. Some cells start as open (white), some start as closed (orange red), and one starts as open and full (light green)\n 2. The open and full cell will then look at all of its eight surrounding neighbors (up, down, left, right and diagonals) and if any of them are open and not full, it will fill them (turn light green)\n 3. The simulation appears stopped when there are no more cells that are able to be filled
PPRules = Predator Prey Rules:\n 1. Some cells start out as sharks (orange red), some start out as fish (light green) and some start out as empty (white)\n 2. Every turn of the simulation a fish will move to a random neighbor cell unless all four are occupied (up, down, left, right)\n 3. If a fish cell has survived the number of cycles necessary to breed, a new fish will be produced if there is an empty neighbor cell\n 4. Also, sharks eat fish. If there are multiple fish in a neighboring cell, it chooses one at random. If there are no neighbor fishes, it moves the same way as fish\n 5. If a shark cell does not eat in a certain number of turns then it will die. If it has survived the number of cycles necessary to breed, a new shark will be produced if there is an empty neighbor cell\n 6. The simulation is continuous unless one species overtakes the other
SegRules = Segregation Rules:\n 1. Some cells start as population 1 (orange red), some start as population 2 (light green) and some are empty (white)\n 2. Each cell will determine if it is satisfied with its position. This means that it will check if it is surrounded by a preset percentage of cells like itself (of the same population) \n 3. If a cell is not satisfied, then it will move to an empty cell\n 4. The simulation will run as long as it can until all cells are completely satisfied and ‘segregated’. This means the simulation could be continuous
GOLRules = Game Of Life Rules:\n 1. Some cells start as alive (light green) and others start as dead (white)\n 2. If a cell that is alive has greater than three or less than two neighbors that are also alive, then that cell will die (turn white). If the cell has exactly 2 or 3 neighbors that are alive, then that cell stays alive (stays light green)\n 3. If a cell that is dead has exactly 3 alive neighbors, then it will become alive (turn light green)\n 4. The simulation is continuous
FireRules = Fire Rules:\n 1. All cells start as trees (light green) except for one cell that is set to burning (orange red) and an outer boundary that is set to burnt/empty (white)\n 2. Every burnt/empty cell throughout the simulation will stay burnt/empty\n 3. Each burning cell will look at each of its four neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is burnt/empty, it won’t affect that cell. If a neighbor cell is a tree, then that cell may or may not be changed to burning based off of a preset probability\n 4. All burning cells only stay burning for one cycle, and then they change to burnt/empty\n 5. The simulation stops running when there are no more burning cells
